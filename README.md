# elm-to-pages ðŸŒ³
`elm-to-gh-pages` is a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys an Elm app to GitHub Pages.

## Usage
In a _public_ GitHub repo, create a directory `.github/workflows` and put [`elm-to-gh-pages.yml`](./elm-to-gh-pages.yml) in it.

Now, go to `Settings > Pages > Source` and choose `GitHub Actions` instead of `Deploy from a branch`.

On your next push, your Elm app will be deployed to `yourusername.github.io/yourreponame`!

## Configuration

If you would like compile your app to JS instead of HTML, update the command in the `Build Elm artifact` section to `elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js`. Make sure that you have an `index.html` file in your repo.

If your app does not use `Debug` and you would like the compiled code to be optimized, use `elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js --optimize`.

To take it one step further, you can add the following block below the `Build Elm artifact step`.

```yaml
- name: Install uglify.js
  run: npm install uglify-js -g
- name: Uglify main.js
  run: uglifyjs main.js --compress "pure_funcs=[F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9],pure_getters,keep_fargs=false,unsafe_comps,unsafe" | uglifyjs --mangle --output main.js
```
